Why did we declare the table as list_t **table? We don't know up front how big we want the table to be. Therefore, we need to make the table a dynamic array. Remember that an array is just a big block of memory and is basically synonymous with a pointer (see the SparkNotes on arrays and pointers. What we have is a pointer to a pointer to a linked list; thus list_t **table.

Functions

What basic operations do we need to be able to perform with our hash tables?: 1) We need to be able to create a table. 2) We need to be able to hash; thus we need a hash function. 3) We need to be able to free a table. 4) We need to be able to insert into them. 5) We need to be able to lookup an element in them. That should do it for a basic implementation.

1. Creation. We need to be able to create a hash table, something like:


    hash_table_t *my_hash_table;
    int size_of_table = 12;
    my_hash_table = create_hash_table(size_of_table);

The creation function might look something like this:


    hash_table_t *create_hash_table(int size)
    {
        hash_table_t *new_table;
        
        if (size<1) return NULL; /* invalid size for table */

        /* Attempt to allocate memory for the table structure */
        if ((new_table = malloc(sizeof(hash_value_t))) == NULL) {
            return NULL;
        }
        
        /* Attempt to allocate memory for the table itself */
        if ((new_table->table = malloc(sizeof(list_t *) * size)) == NULL) {
            return NULL;
        }

        /* Initialize the elements of the table */
        for(i=0; i<size; i++) new_table->table[i] = NULL;

        /* Set the table's size */
        new_table->size = size;

        return new_table;
    }

2. Our hash function. We'll go with a relatively simple one.


    unsigned int hash(hash_table_t *hashtable, char *str)
    {
        unsigned int hashval;
        
        /* we start our hash out at 0 */
        hashval = 0;

        /* for each character, we multiply the old hash by 31 and add the current
         * character.  Remember that shifting a number left is equivalent to 
         * multiplying it by 2 raised to the number of places shifted.  So we 
         * are in effect multiplying hashval by 32 and then subtracting hashval.  
         * Why do we do this?  Because shifting and subtraction are much more 
         * efficient operations than multiplication.
         */
        for(; *str != '\0'; str++) hashval = *str + (hashval << 5) - hashval;
        /* we then return the hash value mod the hashtable size so that it will
         * fit into the necessary range
         */
        return hashval % hashtable->size;
    }

3. String lookup. Doing a string lookup is as simple as hashing the string, going to the correct index in the array, and then doing a linear search on the linked list that resides there.


    list_t *lookup_string(hash_table_t *hashtable, char *str)
    {
        list_t *list;
        unsigned int hashval = hash(hashtable, str);

        /* Go to the correct list based on the hash value and see if str is
         * in the list.  If it is, return return a pointer to the list element.
         * If it isn't, the item isn't in the table, so return NULL.
         */
        for(list = hashtable->table[hashval]; list != NULL; list = list->next) {
            if (strcmp(str, list->str) == 0) return list;
        }
        return NULL;
    }

4. Inserting a string. Inserting a string is almost the same as looking up a string. Hash the string. Go to the correct place in the array. Insert the new string at the beginning.


    int add_string(hash_table_t *hashtable, char *str)
    {
        list_t *new_list;
        list_t *current_list;
        unsigned int hashval = hash(hashtable, str);

        /* Attempt to allocate memory for list */
        if ((new_list = malloc(sizeof(list_t))) == NULL) return 1;

        /* Does item already exist? */
        current_list = lookup_string(hashtable, str);
            /* item already exists, don't insert it again. */
        if (current_list != NULL) return 2;
        /* Insert into list */
        new_list->str = strdup(str);
        new_list->next = hashtable->table[hashval];
        hashtable->table[hashval] = new_list;

        return 0;
    }

5. Deleting a table. Freeing up the memory you use is a very good habit, so we write a function to clear out the hashtable.


    void free_table(hash_table_t *hashtable)
    {
        int i;
        list_t *list, *temp;

        if (hashtable==NULL) return;

        /* Free the memory for every item in the table, including the 
         * strings themselves.
         */
        for(i=0; i<hashtable->size; i++) {
            list = hashtable->table[i];
            while(list!=NULL) {
                temp = list;
                list = list->next;
                free(temp->str);
                free(temp);
            }
        }

        /* Free the table itself */
        free(hashtable->table);
        free(hashtable);
    }
